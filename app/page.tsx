          <br />

          <br />
          <p>BETH began as a meme but grew into a thriving community on Solana. <span className="logo">BethSwap</span> continues that momentum in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, making it simpler and more rewarding for BETH holders to trade, stake, and interact. <span className="logo">BethSwap</span> is more than just a DEX; it’s where the memecoin culture meets genuine utility and community-driven rewards.</p>
